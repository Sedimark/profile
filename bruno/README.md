## Using the Profile API with Bruno

You can test the API using [Bruno](https://docs.usebruno.com/introduction/what-is-bruno) by following these steps:

1. Create your `.env` file in the present directory to set the URL of the API (`PROFILE_URL`) and its API key (`API_KEY`). You can do so by copying the `.env.example` file and modifying it accordingly:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Open Bruno and import this collection.
